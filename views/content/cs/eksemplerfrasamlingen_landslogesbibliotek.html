    <p><i>Den Norske Store Landsloge</i> is the name of the Norwegian Order of Freemasons from before 1934 and thus one of the stamps that can be found on many of the books in the collection. The largest Norwegian Masonic book collection is from the Masonic headquarters in Oslo. The library can be dated back to 1818, and included among other things Frederick V’s bible, which was the first printed bible in a Scandinavian language. This entire library was seized in 1940 when Norwegian Freemasonry was suppressed and all property belonging to Freemasons fell to the Norwegian NS regime. The Freemason’s library, archives and other property was sent to the German SS headquarters in Berlin in the autumn of 1941. In 1943, the books were moved from Berlin to Silesia and deposited in castles that were used for storage of material that had to be saved from the Allied bombing. In 1947, parts of the seized material were returned to the Norwegian masonic lodge from Offenbach Archival Depot. In 2009, another part of the collection was returned from Poznan in Poland. There are still several parts of the collection located in different parts of Europe. Norwegian Freemasons work actively for repatriation, meaning that all the books from 1940 will be returned to Norway.</p>
    <p>We do not yet know how many books were in the collection; until now, seven have been found in this collection, but by examining stamps and ex libris bookplates, we know that the books come from the Norwegian lodge even though the books are not written in Norwegian.</p>
