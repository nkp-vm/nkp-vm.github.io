    <p>(note: tentative text only) Eugen Müllendorff (1855 Steinau an der Oder-1934 Berlin) German engineer, writer and influential freemason. Educated as engineer at Universities Breslau, Leipzig, Dresden and Charlottenburg and dr. philos at University of Vienna. He was editor of the technical magazine «Zeitschrift Blätter für Elektrotechnik und Bauwesen», Cologne and worked as a technical adviser for the Magistrate in Berlin.</p>
    <p>Müllendorff was a member of the lodge «Zu den drei goldenen Schlüsseln» in Berlin and grand master from 1916 to 1931 for the very dogmatic and influential grand lodge «Großen Landesloge der Freimaurer von Deutschland». He had a strong influence of the development of German Freemasonry between the two world wars and contributed strongly to its radicalization. Under his leadership his grand lodge distansed itself from the rest of German Freemasonry, especially the pasifist tendencies in some of the liberal grand lodges, and moved his grand lodge into selfimposed isolation. In order to counteract this isolation, Müllendorff tried to expand the relations to Scandinavian Freemasonry. As part of this process the masonic rituals of his grand lodge were changed according to «Swedish Rite». He also tried to expand his grand lodge territory by starting up new German lodges in the border areas to France, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Denmark which led to international masonic implications.</p>
    <p>After Hitler came to power Müllendorff as well as most other German masonic leaders for more than a year from September 1934 were kept under strict surveillance by the security police. When these investigations led to nothing, SD-Chief Heydrich was gradually convinced that German freemasonry was unable to be a serious opponent for the nazi regime.</p>
