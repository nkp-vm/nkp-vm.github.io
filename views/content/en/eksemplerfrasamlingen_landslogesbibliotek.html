    <p>Books from the Norwegian Masonic Grand Lodge are found in the collections of the National Library of the Czech Republic. The Norwegian collections containing the Freemasons’ own books were the only book collections sent out of Norway during the Second World War. The fact that these books have now been found in the National Library of the Czech Republic, some 70 years later, is a bit of a sensation. We do not yet know what books the collection comprises, but by examining stamps and ex libris labels, we are certain that the books come from the Norwegian lodge. The Norwegian Masonic Grand Lodge is the name of the Norwegian Order of Freemasons prior to 1934. This lodge has had its library in the Masonic Lodge premises in Oslo. The library may date back to 1818, and should include among other things Frederick V’s bible, which was the first printed bible in a Scandinavian language. This library was seized in its entirety in 1940 when Norwegian Freemasonry was abolished by the German occupation. This book collection and other masonic collections were sent to the German SS library in Berlin in the autumn of 1941. In 1943, the books were moved from Berlin to Schlesien and deposited in castles that were used for storage of material that had to be saved from the Allied bombing. In 1947, parts of the seized material were returned to the Norwegian masonic lodge from Offenbach Archival Depot. In 2009, another part of the collection was returned from Poznan in Poland. There are still several parts of the collection located in different parts of Europe. Norwegian Freemasons work actively for repatriation, meaning that all the books from 1940 will be returned to Norway.</p>
