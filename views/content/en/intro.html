<p>In the National Library of the Czech Republic in Prague, a cache of books that had gone unnoticed for many years was rediscovered. The books remained untouched and were not registered in the library’s catalogues. When employees at the National Library began to look at the books, they quickly discovered that these were books that had been confiscated during the Second World War and books that were intended to be saved from the bombing of German towns. Confiscated books from after the war were also found – books that the Czechoslovakian Communist regime seized. This was the beginning of the unravelling of a story the end of which is still not in sight.</p>
<p>A simple estimate is that some 12 million books may have been seized after the Second World War in Czechoslovakia alone. Most of these books were handled by Czechoslovakia’s national library and many of them originate from the period during the Second World War.</p>
<p>Today, the National Library of the Czech Republic has a collection of 300,000 books of foreign origin and has selected about 12,000 titles of seized books that have stamps or the owners’ names on them, so that work may begin to discover the history of these books and perhaps also to answer questions such as: Who owned these books and why were they seized? What happened to the owners of the books? Why did the books end up in Czechoslovakia’s national library?</p>
<p>The book collection in the National Library of the Czech Republic tells many tales. One of them is the history of totalitarian regimes’ attempts to exterminate undesirable people and their historical writings. In this exhibition, you will encounter the stories of some of the books, and their owners, that the Nazis and communists tried to eliminate. You will also encounter the history of two countries that, in different ways, were changed by the Nazis’ presence.</p>
