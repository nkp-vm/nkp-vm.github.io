    <p>One of the oldest Freemason lodges in Europe was the German Grosse National-Mutterloge “Zu den drei Weltkugeln”. When Hitler came to power and Freemasonry was prohibited, the leadership of the Grosse National-Mutterloge gave in to pressure from the Nazis and the lodge became a secular order and thus was liquidated in 1935. The Grand Master of that lodge is famous for his letter to Hitler: “We are no longer Freemasons. Give our 20 000 members a chance to contribute to the Nazi people’s state...” A large part of the Grand Lodge’s library before the Second World War is now part of an institute at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, but some of these books also ended up in the Prague collection. They were probably moved here when Germany was bombed by the Allies and all valuable collections moved abroad. Up to now, well over a hundred titles have been found that belonged to the Grosse National-Mutterloge “Zu den drei Weltkugeln”.</p>
