    <p>One of the eldest lodges in Europe, were the Grosse National-Mutterloge «Zu den drei Weltkugeln». When Hitler came to power and banned freemasonry, the leadership of the grandlodge gave in and transformed the lodge to a secular order and it was liquidated in 1935 with all other lodges in Germany. The grand master’s letter to Hitler is famous: “We are not freemasons anymore. Please give our 20 000 members the chance to contribute to build a Nazi people’s state …”. A substantial part of the grand lodges library before the Second World War is today part of a collection at the Masonic Institute at the Mickiewitch University in Poznan, but a part of these books also ended up in the collection in Prague. They probably came to Prague during 1943 when the biggest German cities were evacuated for cultural valuables.</p>
