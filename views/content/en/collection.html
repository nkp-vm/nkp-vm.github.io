    <p>In the National Library of the Czech Republic in Prague today we find a collection of 300,000 books that originate from during and just after the Second World War. This collection consists of Masonic literature, Nazi propaganda from SS libraries, cultural treasures and general literature seized from people who were arrested and perhaps deported. What happened? Why did these books end up in the collection? The answer is to be found in the books themselves, if we can give them the time and investigation needed to tell their story.</p>
    
    <p>In 1939, the Nazis established a separate Reiche Security Central Office. Its first head was Reinhard Heydrich, until he was the target of a successful assassination in Prague in 1942. </p>

    <p>The next head was Ernst Kaltenbrunner. This headquarters had a department VII, a department for written sources. They were assigned to see that the Nazification of the occupied countries went as it should, and they were to produce anti-Jewish and anti-masonic propaganda. In several instances, the tasks of Alfred Rosenberg’s foreign department for ERR and those of the RSHA overlap, but there is reason to believe that the books in the National Library’s collection originate from collections made by RSHA.</p>

    <p>In the time after the Nazis, some 12 million books were seized in Czechoslovakia. These were books that had belonged to Germans, books the Nazis themselves had seized and which already had been taken from their rightful owners, Nazis’ own book collections and books the communists thought would not serve the people.</p>
    
    <p>The collection of books gone astray after the Second World War had been forgotten, but is now rediscovered and illustrates that no matter how many times a totalitarian regime attempts to limit freedom of speech, ban books and organisations, seize and steal valuable material, remove art from the people who have brought it into the world, this will never succeed.</p>
