    <p>Schwartz-Bostunitsch, born in 1883, originally came from Riga, but his family was partly German and he travelled a lot to Germany during his childhood and adolescence. In the period between the wars, Schwartz-Bostunitsch became interested in the text: “Protocols of the Elders of Zion”, which claims that the Jews want global domination. His interest also included Freemasonry and Communism. Schwartz-Bostunitsch travelled around the Balkans in the period between the wars and held lectures on “The Jewish-Freemason-Bolshevik Conspiracy”. He also became very interested in the occult and Theosophy. In 1922 he published his first book, Freemasonry and the Russian Revolution. In 1924, he took German citizenship and was eventually seen as an expert on secret, transnational forces in the world. This made him popular as a contributor in the National Socialist German Worker’s Party’s (NADAP) magazine, <i>Weltkampf</i>, where Alfred Rosenberg was editor. Schwartz-Bostunitsch became active in political circles around the Nazis, and throughout the 1920s worked for the Nazi news agency <i>Weltdienst</i>. Here, he came in close contact with the SS. He especially supported Heinrich Himmler because of his anti-Semitism. In 1935, he became a <i>Hauptsturmführer</i>, and held lectures about Jews, Freemasons and others who “conspired” against the Nazis, using his book Freemasonry as background. In 1944, he was promoted to SS <i>Standartenführer</i> on Himmler’s personal recommendation.</p>
    <p>Schwartz- Bostunitsch had a large library with anti-Semitic literature, with books on Freemasonry, the occult and secret organizations. He wanted to donate his collection to an institute that in future would deal with conspiracies. When Berlin was bombed early in 1944, Schwartz-Bostunitsch and his wife took the entire library with them to a castle in Silesia. What happened to it after that remains unknown. Schwartz-Bostunitsch is on a prisoner list of SS members that the US Army had, but today, this document is to be found in an archive in Moscow. It is believed that Schwartz-Bostunitsch died in 1945. Correspondence between him and Himmler, and other high-standing SS officers, is found in the German Federal Archives.</p>
