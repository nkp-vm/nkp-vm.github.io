    <p>The German-Ukranian SS-officer, Gregor Schwartz-Bostunitsch, was one of the leading figures in abolishing the German freemasonry. When Hitler came to power in 1933, Schwartz-Bostunitsch had already written a book warning about the freemasonry, and he therefor had an influence on this work. Early on he was in contact with Alfred Rosenberg who used him in his ideological work. As the Nazis put up exhibtitons to show people "degenerated art", "entartete Kunst", Schwartz-Bostunitsch had also put together an exhibiton about German freemasonry and made his own museum called Deutsche Freimauermuseum in Bayreuth. There were also three other museums showing various exhibitions and these were visited by hundreds of thousands before the war. What was on show, was the confiscated belongings to the abolished German lodges. In 1939 the Berlin museum was taken down. One of Schwartz-Bostunitsch's last assignments was to present in Prague the material for a new book he was working on about bolchevism. After the Second World War he was arrested by the Americans. Since his books are to be found in the Czeck National Library, the thesis that he came back to Prague to fight with Banders, an Ukrainian group fighting for Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union, after his imprisonments, can be true. His books in the National Library are marked with his and his wife Frikka's beautiful Ex librises.</p>
