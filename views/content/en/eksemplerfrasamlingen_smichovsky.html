    <p>Smichovsky’s (1897-1951) life was full of contradictions. He was temperamental, intelligent and had an exceptional memory. He was a fascist and worked as a spy for the Nazis, while simultaneously being a Cabalist and Satanist.  He had nicknames such as “small town devil” and “the devil’s comrade”. He grew up in a rich, Catholic family in Prague and studied law as a young man. During the First World War, he was called in for military service and served in the intelligence service at the Italian front.  At the first opportunity he deserted and as an Italian prisoner of war became part of the Czechoslovakian legion while he served in the Italian intelligence service. In 1920, he was back in Prague and completed his education in law. Thereafter he moved and studied theology in Rome and philosophy in Toulouse. He spoke several languages fluently besides Czech and German; Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Italian, and French; and he read English. He was an expert in Cabalism and exorcism, which he also practiced. He loved books and had a large library that contained many rare editions. When the Nazi’s occupied Czechoslovakia, Smichovsky was quickly contacted by the German intelligence service, SD. They threatened him into cooperation by referring to his spying activities during the First World War. Smichovsky contributed with information to the Nazis on Freemasons, the anti-Austrian “Mafia,” the Sokol (youth sports) movement and occult associations. He had his own office at the university library in Prague. The Nazis rapidly discovered that the information he gave them was faulty, and discovered that he himself had cultivated contact with Freemasons and Jesuits, as well as that he was homosexual. Smichovsky was therefore arrested and sat in prison three times during the Second World War, the last time in May, 1945. Even though he was set free when the war was over, he was again imprisoned in 1946, this time by the post-war government, but was set free when he claimed to have documents that could compromise President Benes. When the Communists came to power in 1948, Smichovsky began to work in the secret police where he had extensive use for his experience as a spy and intelligence agent. Nevertheless, he must have done something wrong because later he was arrested again and sat in prison in 1951 when he died as the result of an injury inflicted by a prison officer. Other versions of his death have circulated, in which some suggest that he was taken by the devil himself in his cell, or that he converted to Judaism and died as a result of blood poisoning after having been circumcised.</p>
    <p>Smichovsky’s private library is considered to have been the largest collection of occult literature in Czechoslovakia. While he sat in prison, the National Library wrote to the Ministry of Education, which until then had Smichovsky’s library in its safekeeping, and asked to have the books handed over. The history of Smichovsky’s occult library tells another story about this collection; a tale in which the National Library itself played a role in the acquisition of the books.</p>
