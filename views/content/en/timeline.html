    <p>The Nazification of German society begins. A New World Order is to be created and this requires strict control of all ideas. Henceforth, what people see, listen to and read is subject to propaganda, censorship and seizure. All artistic expressions that oppose Nazism are prohibited. Everything that can be perceived as criticism, scorn or derision is prohibited. The same applies to the literature and art that according to the Nazis does not have a high enough artistic and moral level to benefit the Germanic people.</p>

    <p>Members of the Nazi student organizations burn the universities’ books and are followed by 40 000 demonstrators and Joseph Goebbels, who delivers a speech in which he states that the family and the state from now on shall have the highest morals, and therefore all works by authors’ who have written “degenerate” literature will be burned. Book burnings are held throughout Germany. After this, several of the German authors that are censored leave the country. For example, the Nobel Prize winning author, Thomas Mann takes Czech citizenship in the late 30s, and settles first in France, then in Switzerland before he and his family settle in the USA and take American citizenship.

    <p>France, England, Germany and Italy enter into an agreement and sign a treaty distributing the Czech region known as Sudetenland among Germany, Poland and Hungary. More than 50% of the inhabitants in Sudetenland are German-speaking, and Hitler demands that Sudetenland becomes a part of the Third Reiche. All Czechoslovakian libraries are closed and many books destroyed. This applies not only to public libraries, but also to libraries in cloisters and palaces.

    <p>The remaining Czech areas in Czechoslovakia are occupied by Germans and called the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.

All literature about masonry, socialist literature and books written by Jewish authors, emigrant authors and soldiers of the Foreign Legion from the First World War are removed from the libraries.

    <p>The various university libraries in the Czechoslovakian areas that are occupied by Germany in 1939 lose large parts of their collections due to German seizures. Charles University loses almost a half million titles. The Technical University loses 60 000 books. The Academy of Fine Arts in Prague loses 2 500 titles. Masaryk University in Brno loses 250 000 books. The libraries at the Agricultural University and the technological faculty at the University of Pardubice also have many of their books confiscated. In addition to the universities, other institutions are also closed.</p>

    <p>A special division for the Ministry of Propaganda in Berlin visits publishers and bookshops and seizes German and Russian literature. One of the books that it is important to remove is Herman Rauschning’s book, <i>Hitler Speaks</i> which was published by Aschehoug only a few months before the occupation.  It describes the political relationships in Hitler’s inner circle. If they happen upon them, the special division also seizes <i>My Life</i>, by Leon Trotsky and <p>Peat Bog Soldiers</p> by Wolfgang Langhoff, where conditions in German concentration camps are described.</p>

The Norwegian list, “Vern av norsk bokheim” (Protection of the Norwegian book repositories), is ready at the beginning of 1941 and is used by Norwegian policemen and sheriffs, who are required to perform seizures in addition to what is done by the German authorities.</p>

    <p>The <i>German Reichskommissariat Norwegen</i> begins major seizures and decides that all Jewish literature and so-called emigrant literature is to be removed from publishing houses, bookshops, and libraries.

    <p>Frithjoof Sælen (1917-2004) publishes the book <i>Snorre Sel [Snorri the Seal]</i>, and it is a great success, garnering a good reception even from the Deutsche Zeitung in Norwegen. The book about the little seal’s fight for survival in the dangerous Arctic Ocean where the polar bear Brummelabb and the killer whale Glefs (Snap) are threats, sells almost an entire edition of 12 500 books very quickly. Only a month later, the book is prohibited after the Norwegian NS authorities receive complaints that the book’s message is political. The book is, according to the subtitle, “A fable in colors for adults and children”. The drawing of Snorri the seal’s ice float vaguely resembles the shape of Norway. The adventure about the young seal’s fight can be read as a satirical story about Norway’s fight against the Soviet Union (Brummelabb) and Nazi Germany (Glefs), where Snorri the Seal triumphs at last. There is a particularly laughable part where two gulls with yellow glints in their eyes and red marks on their heads continuously shout "Skui, skui", a poorly hidden analogy to the Norwegian Nazis, their swastika and greeting: "Heil og sæl".</p>

    <p>As of February 1942, all Norwegian publishing houses must be members of the new, Nazified Publishers Association. All publishing houses are also required to send in applications to the authorities for each book they wish to publish. Thus manuscripts are censored before they come out in book form. During 1942, several traditional publishing houses resign from the Publishers Association, and the censorship rules and regulations are rescinded in their entirety.</p>

At Offenback, art, documents, books, and archives are handled. The center at Offenbach is located in what previously was the five-story IG-Farben chemical manufacturing plant. From this center, over 5 million books and manuscripts from more than 4 000 European public and private libraries throughout Europe and Russia, are returned to their rightful owners. In August 1945, many US librarians serving in the military are ordered to work with the enormous numbers of books found here.</p>
