    <p>The Nazis’ aim to create a new, Germanic world order required strict control of all ideas and all counter-cultures that had flourished during the interwar years. What people read, saw and listened to had to accommodate the fostering of the Germanic, the Aryan, racially pure person. By strictly controlling available cultural expression, all ideas belonging to the enemy were to be removed. All forms of expression that questioned Nazism, all forms of cultural expression that could counter the building of the Germanic spirit, were banned. A positive image of Nazi Germany and the German people was to be created in all the occupied areas. To achieve this, the Nazis made use of well-known methods: censorship, seizure and propaganda.</p>

    <p><h2>"Czechoslovakia - The link between east and west"</h2></p>

    <div quotebox type="quote"> <p>Understanding the acrimonious conflict, which currently applies to Czechoslovakia’s independence, which yesterday applied to Austria and tomorrow will apply to all democratic peoples, must find its foundation in today’s political forces and the past’s long and changing development.</p> </div>

    <p>During 1938-1939, Germany took control of the Czech areas of Czechoslovakia where a high percentage of German-speaking people, so-called Sudeten Germans, lived. After German occupation of Sudetenland in 1938, all public Czech libraries and school libraries were closed. All undesirable literature was removed.</p>

    <p>Norway was occupied on 9 April 1940. The day after, the German Gestapo conducted raids on publishing houses, bookshops and libraries to remove and destroy all examples of a book that had already been banned in Germany: <i>Gespräche mit Hitler [Hitler Speaks]</i> by Hermann Rauschning. This was the start of a long process to Nazify the Norwegian society and remove undesirable literature. </p>

    <p>The list of authors and books that were banned was long, and became increasingly longer during the war years. The lists were originally German, but were adapted to the individual countries where German censorship and the practice of seizure were to be carried out.</p>

    </div>

    <p>In Norway, the lists were followed up by the German Gestapo, Norwegian police and members of the Norwegian fascist party, Nasjonal Samling (NS). Some Norwegian publishing houses were shut down; others had to acquiesce to being controlled. The libraries’ collections were thoroughly inspected. Each month, someone from either the Norwegian or German authorities came to check the shelves, to verify that there were no banned books in the library, but also to check whether librarians put the literature on display that they had been ordered to promote. This could be German literature or literature that portrayed the New Order in the country in a favorable light.</p>

        <p>It took only a few days after Norway was occupied until the public libraries were visited by German Gestapo who removed illegal titles from the shelves. After the war, the librarians at the public library in Kristiansand, like many other librarians in Norway, recalled that they had encouraged people they knew were against the occupation to borrow the banned books on “long-term loan”. Thus some of the titles were not found in the libraries, but were in private homes until after the war ended. </p>
    </div>
    <p>The Nazi lists of banned books contained in particular books written by Jews and Communists, but could also include books that were banned due to their artistic or moral content. If the author of a book was Jewish, the book by definition was worthless and downright destructive to the German people.</p>

    <div readmore title="The Red Library at Rjukan" id="detrodebibliotek">
        <p>Between 1917 and 1936, the current head of the Rjukan library, Henrik J. Hjartøy, collected a large number of books, magazines and tracts that addressed various aspects of the workers movement. With the occupation of Norway, this collection attracted the keen attention of the Germans, who wanted all Marxist literature removed from Norwegian public book collections. Early during the Occupation, head librarian Anders Andreassen lent out, long term, several important titles, as did many other public libraries around the country. The rarest books in the collection were stored in the tower of the town’s church, where there was little chance the Germans would find them. Otherwise, “The Red Library” was packed up in wooden boxes and sent to the Cultural Ministry’s premises in Oslo. After the war, all of this was returned intact to Rjukan.</p>

    <p><h2>“Know your enemy” - With a right to plunder</h2></p>
    <p>The Nazis’ collection and seizure of Jewish and Freemason writings started already in 1935. As the war continued, the collections of “enemy” literature that was to be studied became larger and larger in step with the expansion of Nazi Germany. In Germany and the occupied countries, there were particularly two main organizations that were responsible for the seizure of “enemy” literature. One was the ERR (Alfred Rosenberg’s <i>Einsatzstab</i>), a separate department under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that was responsible for the ideological building up of the study of the Nazis’ enemies. The other was <i>Reichsicherheitshauptamt</i> (RSHA), which, under the leadership of Richard Heydrich in the SS until he was the target of a successful assassination in Prague in 1942, was to fight the ideological resistance to Nazi Germany. <i>Sicherheitsdienst</i> (SD) was responsible for executive aspects of the operation and seized millions of books in Germany and the occupied areas. In addition to being responsible for the greatest plundering of Jewish and other persecuted groups’ valuable collections of art, literature and archives, RSHA, after reorganization in 1940, was also responsible for the planning and execution of the systematic mass murders of Jews, Poles and Russians in Eastern Europe with the help of the infamous SS-Einsatz commandos. </p>

    <p><h2>Freemasonry - “A Jewish fighting organization”</h2></p>
    <p>According to the National Socialist view, Freemasons were the Jews’ extended arm. Since the Jews were the Nazis’ main enemy, so were Freemasons. According to a Norwegian propaganda edition entitled: “Freemasonry’s secret: disclosures built on authentic material from the seized Masonic archives in Oslo etc.” from 1942, the “outermost left wing of International Judaism [is] thus communism. The outermost right wing is masonry and Jewish high finance”. Only one month after Hitler came to power, the first lodge libraries were seized in Germany. All masonry was abolished in Germany in 1935. Eventually, Freemasons were persecuted and many from Germany and the occupied countries were interned in concentration camps.</p>
    <p>The collection of seized books in the National Library contains a major portion of Freemason literature.</p>
