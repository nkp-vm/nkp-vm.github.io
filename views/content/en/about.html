<p>The main objective of the <i>Books Discovered Once Again</i> project is to document dispossessed books brought to the Czech territory during World War II or immediately after, in accordance with applicable standards, and to store them safely. 12,000 library documents will be processed throughout the project. In tandem with the processing of these books, archival research is being conducted as we are interested in the broader historical context of these books. The findings will be presented via appropriate scientific outputs. This virtual exhibit is part of the ambition to communicate the ongoing project and its findings also to the general public. We are the first to venture into the unexplored area of research into the historical context of books that were confiscated and brought in the post-war period. Legal examination is necessary to clarify the property rights to these library collections.</p>

<p>While the documentation of the books is the <a href="http://www.en.nkp.cz/">National Library of the Czech Republic</a> responsabuility, partner <a href="http://www.stiftelsen-arkivet.no/english">Stiftelsen Arkivet</a> role in the project is to communicate the project to the general public through virtual exhibit and final seminar. 

<p>In March 2016, an exhibit together with two expert seminars will take place. The official end of the project is scheduled for 30 April 2016. For further details about the project, its process and findings, visit <a href="http://knihyznovunalezene.eu/en/index.html">the project web site</a>.</p>
