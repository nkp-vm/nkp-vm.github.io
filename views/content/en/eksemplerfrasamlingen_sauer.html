    <p>Sauer was an Austrian literary critic who lived for periods of his life in Prague. From 1907-1908, he was the rector of the German University in Prague, and he was an important figure among the German Czechoslovakians. In the collection, there are several hundred titles from his large and abundant library, which primarily consisted of literature and books about literature. Sauer’s books can be identified by three ex libris labels and one stamp that he used. Because August Sauer died in 1926, we do not know how the books came to the National Library. There are two possible explanations. Sauer’s wife, Helga, may have sold her husband’s library and the books may later have been given as a gift to the National Library. The books may also have been seized after the war because she was German by nationality. Sauer’s books in the collection contribute by telling one of the many stories that make up the collection of 300,000 foreign books in the National Library of the Czech Republic.</p>
