    <p>Saurer, born in 1855, was an Austrian Professor of German Studies and literature critique who from 1892 lived in Prague and worked at the German University. From 1897-1899, he was the Dean of the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, and from 1907-1908, he was a rector at the German University. He stood out as an important person among the Sudeten Germans.  As editor of the magazine German Work, he appeared with nationalistic attitudes just before the First World War, After 1918, he took the part of the newly established state of Czechoslovakia. Through his literary studies he focused particularly on the distinctiveness of the German literature from Sudetenland while simultaneously insisting that to be German in Czechoslovakia was something other than being German in Austria or Germany.  As a convinced nationalist, Sauer also contributed to the history of literature being read as an expression of the distinctive national characteristics of a people, and this was later misused by the Nazis. But by this time, Sauer himself no longer held any influence. He died in Prague in 1926.</p>
<p>In the collection, there are several hundred titles from his large and abundant library, which primarily consisted of literature and books about literature. Sauer’s books can be identified by three ex libris bookplates and one stamp that he used. Because August Sauer died in 1926, we do not know how the books came to the National Library. There are two possible explanations. Sauer’s wife, Helga, may have sold her husband’s library and the books may later have been given as a gift to the National Library. The books may also have been seized after the war because she was German by nationality.</p>
