    <p>(note: tentative text only) US Collecting Point, Offenbach (1945-1952) was the biggest of four joint Western-Allied collection centers for looted books, manuscripts and archival material confiscated by the Germans all over Europe. The three others were situated in Marburg, Wiesbaden and Munich. From this center in Offenbach, situated in a flive-floor former chemical plant of I G Farben, the greatest book restitution in history was performed, and  more than 3 millions looted books and manuscripts from hundreds of llibraries across Europe and Russia were returned to their original owners.</p>
    <p>US Collecting Point Offenbach was a very unusual, but efficient part of what has been called the "cultural Holocaust.", under command of one of the best known «Monument’s Men», US-Colonel Seymour Pomrenze.</p>
    <div quotebox type="quote"> <p>My first impressions of the Offenbach Collecting Point were overwhelming and amazing at once. As I stood before a seemingly endless sea of crates and books, I thought what a horrible mess!</p></div>

    <p>The amount of stolen goods that were transferred to this Center, far exceeded the Allies’ expectations and let General Eisenhower in August 1945 order all trained US Librarians in uniform to be transferred to the Offenbach Center.</p>
    <p>Crates, stacks, packages, and piles bearing some indication of the country of origin were spot checked and set inside pending restitution claims. Following some classification by country and by language, the semi-identifiable piles awaited further processing. The unidentifiable books and other materials were left alone until an opportunity arose for careful study by competent persons, some of them knowledgeable displaced person volunteers. The center used an improvised identification system called  "Bencowitz sorting system," (after the Monument Man Igor Benkowitz) identifying books from ex libris bookplates or stamps found inside book jackets.</p>
    <p>Many books and documents required care and preservation as a result of mishandling, damage during transit, water, mold, and neglect. The OAD did not possess any equipment or materials for care and preservation. Luckily, one of the employees - a former monk - had worked with documents at a religious order. He was assigned to devise homemade care and preservation techniques. One method he used for drying wet books and documents involved hanging them from clothespins and applying extra heat. The technique worked very well.</p>
    <p>The Librarians at the center were the first to discover the vast loot of masonic boooks performed by the nazi organisation Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR) from lodges from Ukraine to the French-Spanish border and from Greece to Norway.</p>
    <p>In March 1946 the Collecting Point had nearly 180 employees. Workers were devoted to the herculean monumental task of receiving, sorting, restoring, and eventually restituting the many items placed within their care.</p>
    <p>The first restituion was performed March 12. 1946 when 371 crates of books was returned to Holland. Czechoslovakia received about 10,000 items from this central. The collections from the four RSHA-Depots in the Silesian-Sudeten Area as well as some of the remaining collections in the RSHA Depots in Berlin were all repatriated from this center.</p>
