    <p>At the end of the 1800s, many new organizations and associations were formed in Prague. Two very important associations were one German and one Czech student associations. Die Lese- und Redehalle was a German student association that was established in February 1849 and which arranged for lectures about antiquity and modern art. The largest stream of members to the organization took place in 1869 and after. In 1859, the association’s library was established and in 1900, the collection consisted of 85 000 titles and was the largest private German library in the Czech part of the Habsburg Empire. In 1870, it was decided that only Germans could be members of the association. Until then, attention had been primarily focused on education and culture; but from the middle of the 1800s, a nationalistic tendency began to characterize the association. Die Lese- und Redehalle was a liberal association, while the more radical and anti-Semitic members broke out and started a new association: Germania. In 1939, the association’s activities ceased since its purpose disappeared and Prague became part of the Third Reich.</p>
