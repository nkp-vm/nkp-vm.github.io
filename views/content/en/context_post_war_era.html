    <p>The practice of controlling enemy property was not unique to the Nazis. After the war, the government in Czechoslovakia that sat from 1945-1948, seized everything that belonged to Germans, collaborators and other enemies of Czechoslovakia and transferred it to Czechs. Czech resistance groups from during the war demanded that the Sudeten German population in Czechoslovakia be expelled from the country and during the Potsdam Conference in August 1945, this was adopted. Well over 2 million Sudeten Germans were expelled to the American zone in Germany and to the Soviet zone, and thereby lost their land and property.</p>
    <p>There were communists in prominent positions in the government after the war, and in 1948, the country was taken over by a Communist government. The Communist regime followed up the policy that was already in practice by confiscating land that belonged to people who emigrated, were dissidents and people who had been sentenced. Books were also seized. Stringent restrictions were applied to freedom of speech and intellectual and artistic expression.  In many ways, the Communists ensured a continuation of the Nazi practice of seizing property and restricting free speech and various intellectual and artistic works.</p>
