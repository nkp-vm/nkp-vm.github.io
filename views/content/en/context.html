    <p>Ever since people began to write down their thoughts, thus spreading ideas, governments and other authorities have attempted to stop the spread of religious, moral or political ideas that might harm or invalidate the establishment's prevailing ideas. Books have been censured, withdrawn, seized and destroyed. Authors and scientists have been persecuted and many have also been mistreated and killed for the thoughts and ideas they have put in writing. Science, politics, religion, art: new ideas can be dangerous, and it is important for a totalitarian regime to control what ideas are thought about and what opinions and attitudes are expressed.</p>
    <p>The Nazis’ aim to create a new, Germanic world order required strict control of all ideas and all counter-cultures that had flourished during the interwar years. What people read, saw and listened to had to accommodate the fostering of the Germanic, the Aryan, racially pure person. Using the strict control of available cultural expression, all ideas belonging to the enemies: Marxism, the Jewish people, the workers' movement, liberalism and democracy, were to be removed. All forms of expression that questioned Nazism, all forms of cultural expression that could counter the building of the Germanic spirit, were banned. A positive image of Nazi Germany and the German people was to be created in all the occupied areas. To achieve this, the Nazis made use of well-known methods: censorship, seizure and propaganda.</p>

    <p>Propaganda is just as important as censorship and seizure for a totalitarian regime. The state can cultivate images of the enemy through propaganda. In Germany, the Jewish people were designated as the main enemy. They were behind the great Communist threat, Freemasonry and otherwise anything that was harmful to society:</p>
        <div quotebox type="quote"> <p>When National Socialism took the helm of the German nation, one of the first and most obvious tasks was to immediately rip German art and cultural life out of the claws of the Jewish gentlemen with their dissolute influence and replace it with real and true creative German art instead of cultural decay. The fact that artistic life was, without compromise, purged and most of the Jewish or Jewish-infected literati and composers were chased out of German cultural life – these incompetent dilettantes and destroyers of art created abroad the allegation that National Socialism “destroys or does harm to the bearers of German art”. [...] Now, the German people have since easily been able to exist without these emigrated “artists”, and German art has flourished anew under its National Socialist leadership.</p></div>
        <p><i>From the propaganda brochure “Kulturvilje og kulturinnsats i det nasjonalsosialistiske rike. Kunsten og folket er ett” (Cultural will and cultural commitment in the National Socialist Reich. Art and the people are one) [1941]</i></p>
    <p><h2>“Czechoslovakia - the link between east and west”</h2></p>
    <p>In 1938, the Czechoslovakian government was forced to cede those parts of the country consisting of Bohemia and Moravia to Germany, which earlier that year had also incorporated Austria into its Greater Germanic Reich. The areas, referred to as Sudetenland, had a high percentage of German-speaking citizens, and had been incorporated into Czechoslovakia after the First World War. In 1939, Germany occupied the remaining parts of the Czech areas. </p>
        <div quotebox type="quote"> <p>Understanding the acrimonious conflict, which currently applies to Czechoslovakia’s independence, which yesterday applied to Austria and tomorrow will apply to all democratic peoples, must find its foundation in today’s political forces and the past’s long and changing development.</p></div>
        <p><i>Torolf Elster: Tsjekkoslovakia og den tyske imperialismen, 1938.</i></p>
    <p>Already in 1938, public libraries and school libraries were closed. All undesirable literature was removed, and literature that presented the view of various groups that the Nazis perceived as enemies was censored, including all literature by Jewish authors, Freemasons and “emigrant” authors (German authors who wrote from other countries), Socialists and soldiers in the Foreign Legion.</p>
    <p>In Norway, similar things occurred. Norway was occupied on 9 April 1940. The day after, the German Gestapo conducted raids on publishing houses, book shops and libraries to remove and destroy all examples of a book that had already been banned in Germany: <i>Hitler har sagt det</i> (Hitler speaks) by Hermann Rauschning. If they found them, the Germans were also to remove two other books that previously had been published in Norwegian: <i>Myrsoldater</i> (The Peat Bog Soldiers) by Wolfgang Langhoff and <i>Mitt liv</i> (My Life) by Leon Trotsky.</p>
    <div quotebox type="quote"> <p>Therefore, if Hitler wins, it is not only state boundaries that are going to be changed. It will mean the end of everything that beforehand had meaning and value for people .</p>
        <p><i>Hermann Rauschning, in <i>Hitler har sagt det</i> (Hitler speaks), 1940.</i></p></div>
    <p>The list of authors and the books that were banned was long, and became increasingly longer during the war years. The lists were originally German, but were adapted to the individual countries where German censorship and the practice of seizure were to be carried out.</p>
    <p>I Norway, the lists were followed up by both the German Gestapo and Norwegians who were members of Nasjonal Samling (NS or National Unity). Some Norwegian publishing houses were shut down; others had to acquiesce to being controlled. The libraries’ collections were thoroughly inspected. Each month, someone from either the Norwegian or German authorities came to check the shelves, to verify that there were no banned books in the library, but also to check whether librarians put the literature on display that they had been ordered to promote. This could be German literature or literature that portrayed the new order in the country in a favourable light.</p>
