    <p>Ever since people began to write down their thoughts, thus spreading ideas, governments and other authorities have attempted to stop the spread of religious, moral or political ideas that might harm or invalidate the establishment's prevailing ideas. Books have been censured, withdrawn, seized and destroyed. Authors and scientists have been persecuted and many have also been mistreated and killed for the thoughts and ideas they have put in writing. Science, politics, religion, art: new ideas can be dangerous, and it is important for a totalitarian regime to control what ideas are thought about and what opinions and attitudes are expressed.</p>

<p>The Nazis’ aim to create a new, Germanic world order required strict control of all ideas and all counter-cultures that had flourished during the interwar years. What people read, saw and listened to had to accommodate the fostering of the Germanic, the Aryan, racially pure person. Using the strict control of available cultural expression, all ideas belonging to the enemies: Marxism, the Jewish people, the workers' movement, liberalism and democracy, were to be removed. All forms of expression that questioned Nazism, all forms of cultural expression that could counter the building of the Germanic spirit, were banned. A positive image of Nazi Germany and the German people was to be created in all the occupied areas. To achieve this, the Nazis made use of well-known methods: censorship, seizure and propaganda.</p>

    <p>Propaganda is just as important as censorship and seizure for a totalitarian regime. The state can cultivate images of the enemy through propaganda. In Germany, the Jewish people were designated as the main enemy. They were behind the great Communist threat, Freemasonry and otherwise anything that was harmful to society:</p>
        <div quotebox type="quote"> <p>When National Socialism took the helm of the German nation, one of the first and most obvious tasks was to immediately rip German art and cultural life out of the claws of the Jewish gentlemen with their dissolute influence and replace it with real and true creative German art instead of cultural decay. The fact that artistic life was, without compromise, purged and most of the Jewish or Jewish-infected literati and composers were chased out of German cultural life – these incompetent dilettantes and destroyers of art created abroad the allegation that National Socialism “destroys or does harm to the bearers of German art”. [...] Now, the German people have since easily been able to exist without these emigrated “artists”, and German art has flourished anew under its National Socialist leadership.</p></div>

   <h2>“Czechoslovakia - the link between east and west”</h2>
    <p>In 1938, the Czechoslovakian government was forced to cede those parts of the country consisting of Bohemia and Moravia to Germany, which earlier that year had also incorporated Austria into its Greater Germanic Reich. The areas, referred to as Sudetenland, had a high percentage of German-speaking citizens, and had been incorporated into Czechoslovakia after the First World War. In 1939, Germany occupied the remaining parts of the Czech areas. </p>
    <p>Already in 1938, public libraries and school libraries were closed. All undesirable literature was removed, and literature that presented the view of various groups that the Nazis perceived as enemies was censored, including all literature by Jewish authors, Freemasons and “emigrant” authors (German authors who wrote from other countries), Socialists and soldiers in the Foreign Legion.</p>
    <div quotebox type="quote"> <p>Understanding the acrimonious conflict, which currently applies to Czechoslovakia’s independence, which yesterday applied to Austria and tomorrow will apply to all democratic peoples, must find its foundation in today’s political forces and the past’s long and changing development.</p></div>

    <p>In Norway, similar things occurred. Norway was occupied on 9 April 1940. The day after, the German Gestapo conducted raids on publishing houses, book shops and libraries to remove and destroy all examples of a book that had already been banned in Germany: <i>Hitler har sagt det</i> (Hitler speaks) by Hermann Rauschning. If they found them, the Germans were also to remove two other books that previously had been published in Norwegian: <i>Myrsoldater</i> (The Peat Bog Soldiers) by Wolfgang Langhoff and <i>Mitt liv</i> (My Life) by Leon Trotsky.</p>
    <div quotebox type="quote"> <p>HVis derfor Hitler seirer, er det ikke bare statsgrenser som kommer til å bli endret. Det vil bety slutten på alt som hittil har hatt mening og verd for menneskene.</p></div>
        <p><i>Hermann Rauschning, in <i>Hitler har sagt det</i> (Hitler speaks), 1940.</i></p>
    <p>The list of authors and the books that were banned was long, and became increasingly longer during the war years. The lists were originally German, but were adapted to the individual countries where German censorship and the practice of seizure were to be carried out.</p>
    <p>In Norway, the lists were followed up by both the German Gestapo and Norwegians who were members of Nasjonal Samling (National Unity, Norwegian fascist party). Some Norwegian publishing houses were shut down; others had to acquiesce to being controlled. The libraries’ collections were thoroughly inspected. Each month, someone from either the Norwegian or German authorities came to check the shelves, to verify that there were no banned books in the library, but also to check whether librarians put the literature on display that they had been ordered to promote. This could be German literature or literature that portrayed the new order in the country in a favourable light.</p>

        <p>It took only a few days after Norway was occupied until the public libraries were visited by the German Gestapo who removed banned titles from the shelves. After the war, the librarians at the public library in Kristiansand, like many other librarians in Norway, recalled that they had encouraged people they knew were against the occupation to borrow the banned books on “long-term loans”. Thus some of the titles were not to be found in the libraries, but remained in private homes until after the war ended. </p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The Nazi lists of banned books contained in particular books written by Jews and Communists, but could also include books that were banned due to their artistic or moral content. If one looks to art, a large proportion of artworks were removed from various museums, galleries and institutions under Nazism because they were deemed “degenerate”: the art was sick. This expression was frequently applied to describe experimental and abstract art. If these prohibitions were to be interpreted, one could say that the Nazis did not want art and literature that was not immediately understandable and that did not promote the German people (the pure race). In addition, if the artwork or book was created or written by a Jewish person or a socialist or communist, the work by definition was worthless and directly destructive to the Germanic people.</p>

    <p>Between 1917 and 1936, the head of the Rjukan library at the time, Henrik J. Hjartøy, collected a large amount of books, magazines and tracts that addressed various aspects of the workers movement. With the occupation of Norway, this collection attracted the keen attention of the Germans, who wanted all Marxist literature removed from Norwegian public book collections. Early during the Occupation, head librarian Anders Andreassen lent out, long term, several important titles, as did many other public libraries around the country. The rarest books in the collection were stored in the tower of the town’s church, where there was little chance the Germans would find them. Otherwise, “The Red Library” was packed up in wooden boxes and sent to the Cultural Ministry’s premises in Oslo. After the war, all of this was returned intact to Rjukan.</p>

    <h2>“Know your enemy” - with a right to plunder</h2>
    <p>In the beginning of the Second World War, Hitler established a separate department under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that was to study the enemies of National Socialism. Alfred Rosenberg, who headed this department, saw to the seizure of as many as possible of the Jews’ and Freemasons’ book collections throughout occupied Europe. In parallel with the ERR (Rosenberg’s Einsatzstab - Taskforce), other departments worked doing the same kind of thing. Throughout all of occupied Europe and Russia, Jewish book collections were consolidated and sent to separate research centres or stored in different places so that they could be examined later. Many collections were also destroyed and the paper reused. The Freemasons’ book collections from lodges throughout Europe shared the same fate. A large number of the books that have been found again in the National Library today are masonic literature.</p>
    
     
    
    <h2>Freemasonry - “a Jewish fighting organisation”</h2>
    <p>According to the National Socialist view, Freemasons were Jews. Since the Jews were the Nazis’ main enemy, so were Freemasons. According to a Norwegian edition entitled: Frimureriets hemmelighet: avsløringer bygget på autentisk materiale fra de beslaglagte frimurerarkiver i Oslo m. m. (Freemasonry’s secret: disclosures built on authentic material from the seized masonry archives in Oslo etc.) from 1942, the “Outermost left wing of International Judaism [is] thus communism. The outermost right wind is masonry and Jewish high finance”. Only one month after Hitler came to power, the first lodge libraries were seized. All masonry was abolished in Germany in 1935. Eventually, Freemasons were persecuted and many from Germany and the occupied countries were interned in concentration camps </p>
