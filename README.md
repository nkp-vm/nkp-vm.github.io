E-Learning-Generic
===

This is a generic version of the HMS project without content. Use it as a template for other projects.
The following custom HTML tags can be used to manage content:


grunt
-----

A gruntfile is used to clean directories, create documentation, uglify javascript, and scan the 'views' tree for dictionary words. Run 'grunt' on command line to update these

META
----
`<meta>` tag should be the first tag in the document. 'name' must be 'module', 'content' must be module number, language code separated by ','


See module 7 (accessed from the side menu) for a demonstration of these widgets including styling
